% controlled term instances can not be instantiated because of enumerations.
% need to either specify controlled terms with size (1,:) to create prop
% with empty value or initialize with default values... (which is sketchy).

% Categories can be used for creating heterogenous superclasses, but if
% some schemas belong to multiple categories, its a problem

% LinkedTypes / EmbeddedTypes with multiple allowed types is also a big problem.
